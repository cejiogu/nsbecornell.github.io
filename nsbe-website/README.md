# Cornell NSBE Website Redesign
## Introduction
This project was undertaken during the fall of 2024 after the newly-elected Cornell NSBE leadership called for a redesign of their website.  

## Original Design
The original design was implemented using HTML, CSS, and Javascript &mdash; all standard tools for the implementation of a website.

## Changes Made
The new design was implemented using React.js with Typescript, Chakra UI as the component library, and Next.js.

## Installation and Setup

To install this application, you must first ensure that your system:
-  Already has Node.js, a Javascript runtime environment, installed
    - If your system does not already have Node.js installed, you can download it [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager)

After having installed Node.js (or if you already had it installed), you can then fork the repository and clone it to your local machine. After having done so, you can open the forked repository in your IDE, and must then install node packages.
- In order to install node packages, you must run ```npm i``` or ```npm install``` in the terminal in the appropriate directory

## Usage Instructions
